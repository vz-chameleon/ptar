<h2>Threads test</h2>
<p>This part will need some manual review. But generally, the execution 
time for the parallel version should be lower than for the sequential 
version. And the three last checks (helgrind, number of threads, number 
of fsync) should all be 'OK'.</p>
Time for sequential version: 4.664211831<br>
Exit code for sequential version: 0<br>
Time for parallel version: 6.35152156<br>
Exit code for parallel version: 0<br>
Execution in helgrind: Failed<br>
